# Alzheimers_Disease_Prediction_Uing_Deep_Learning

This Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Model is based on Convolutional Neural Network, a class of deep neural networks most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

The model is able to predict three different stages of alzheimer's, namely Non-Demented,Mild-Demented & Very-Mild-Demented, with an accuracy of 80%.
